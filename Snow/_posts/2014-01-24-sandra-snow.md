I've been wanting to self-host my blog on my own Windows Azure Website for some time now and I've found the perfect solution (for me) to do that in [Sandra.Snow](https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow).

> Sandra.Snow is a Jekyll inspired static site generation tool that can be run locally, as a CAAS(Compiler as a Service) or setup with Azure to build your site when your repository changes. It is built on top of NancyFX.

It allows me to store all my posts as markdown files on a git repository on GitHub, and having my Website hooked up to that repository so whenever I push a new change/post my site is automatically redeployed and updated.

## What is Microsoft Teams ##

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) is a collaboration and communication platform for organizations and teams that includes: messaging, meetings, calls, file storage, application integrations and more.

## What is Role-Based Messaging ##

Role-based messaging is when you want to message a person (or a group) based on their role instead of their name.

Some examples:
* You want to send a message to the **Assistant to the Regional Manager**.
* You want to recommend a theme to the **Party Planning Committee**.
* You want to report a fire hazard to the **Security Supervisor**.

## How to have role-based messaging in Microsoft Teams ##

Microsoft Teams has a feature called **Tags** which allows a team owner to add a [custom] tag on team members and later you can at-mention the tag in a channel message or start a new chat with this tag.

You can think of this tag as a way to add a role to a team member, for example add the **Assistant to the Regional Manager** tag to Dwight.
Or as a way to group members of a team, for example add the **Party Planning Committee** tag to Pam, Phyllis, Angela and Ryan.

To manage tags in Microsoft Teams you need to click on the ... next to the team you want to manage tags for, there you should see the "Manage tags" menu item. From there you just click on the "Create tag" button and add the team members you want to that tag.

> Note: You need to either be the team owner to manage tags for the team or the team owner can also configure all members of a team to be allowed to manage tags on the "Manage Team / Settings" screen.

In the "Manage tags" you'll be able to see current tags and edit them including renaming a tag or adding/removing team members from a tag. If you remove all members from a tag, the tag will be removed.

Another way to create a tag is on the "Manage team" screen where the view is team member centric instead of tag centric. There you can add 1 or more tags on a specific team member and you can see the different tags each team member has.

While this describes how to manage tags on desktop/web, you can also do it on the mobile app in a similar way.
